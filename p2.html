        <div class="discription">
            <p>Harpy eagles eat pretty much any Amazon animal it can carry off, including monkeys, armadillos, agoutis, and sloths.

                Once they’ve caught their prey they normally carry it to the treetops to eat it. If they’ve caught something a little too big though,
                 they’ll eat it on a fallen tree trunk or somewhere similar.

            <p>In tropical rainforests, all food, insects, fruits, nectar, are available on the spot.
                The toucan, a charming bird that lives in the rainforest, in the tops and middle floors of trees. There are 37 species of toucan in the Amazon.
                Did you know that the hummingbird, the only bird whose wing beat provides thrust and propulsion? It can go backwards like an insect. It is able to have dazzling departures. Its wings beat 20 to 80 times per second. To support this intense activity, the hummingbird feeds on the nectar of odorless flowers every ten minutes at a rate of 50% of its weight per day. Its voluminous heart beats at rest 500 times per minute.
